Introduction: Purpose of the Book
=================================

The purpose of this book is to provide legal services managers with practical techniques for managing underperforming teams, addressing quality and efficiency issues, and promoting overall success in legal operations. We will explore some common causes of underperformance in legal teams, including inadequate training or resources, unclear expectations or goals, ineffective management practices, poor communication or collaboration, lack of accountability, and personal or professional issues that may be affecting individual team members.

Throughout this book, we will focus on several key strategies for managing underperforming teams in legal services. These strategies include identifying underperformance through signs and symptoms, evaluating team performance against KPIs, coaching and development, process improvement, and effective communication and collaboration.

By applying these techniques, legal services managers can improve the performance of their teams, promote overall quality and efficiency, and achieve organizational goals. We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for legal services managers looking to enhance their management skills and effectively address underperformance issues in their organizations.
